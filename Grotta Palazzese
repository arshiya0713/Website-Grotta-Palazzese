            <h4>GROTTA PALAZZESE RESTAURANT, A UNIQUE PLACE</h4>
            <p>A magical and enchanted place, a restaurant with a terrace created inside a natural cave. The Grotta Palazzese restaurant takes its name from the homonymous cave and from the place that was once also called "Grotta di Palazzo". It is an exclusive and atmospheric place, used for parties and banquets since 1700, as evidenced by a watercolor of 1783 by Jean Louis Desprez. The blue of the sea and the sky contrasts with the mysterious atmospheres of the natural cavities. The colors of the day make the beauty of the coastal landscape shine, while those of the evening, at sunset, create unforgettable nuances, in the charm and elegance of the restaurant lights.</p>        
            <h4>A TIMELESS CHARM</h4>
            <p>Grotta Palazzese has always been an unmissable destination for those who love discovering enchanting places and looking for refined cuisine. Since 1700, travelers coming from Europe to Southern Italy stopped at this fascinating place whose beauty was reported in their chronicles. Since then, the charm has remained the same, with a touch of modernity that has made the Grotta Palazzese restaurant even more welcoming and exclusive.</p>
            <h4>A REFINED CUISINE</h4>  
            <p>The Grotta Palazzese Restaurant is not only known for the beauty and the uniqueness of the rock in which it is set. In fact, the kitchen is perfect for all those who are looking for exclusivity and refinement. The dishes are always taken care of in every aspect, with the maximum attention to the quality of the ingredients and the harmony of the 'Visual Food'. They are based largely on foods belonging to the Apulian culinary tradition, with addition of aromas, spices and fragrances for a greater refinement of the dishes.</p>
